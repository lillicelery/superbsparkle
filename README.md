# Superb Sparkle LLC
This is my first development project! I am building this for Superb Sparkle LLC, a professional cleaning service. My goal is to improve/learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as getting comfortable with github actions and version control. While also building a professional image for the company as well.

## Project Goals
* **Professional Brand Image:** Create a clean, beautiful, and trustworthy storefront for a local service business.
* **Technical Growth:** Improve HTML and CSS and learning Javascript along the way.
* **Workflow Mastery:** Using and learning Git and GitHub Actions.

## Roadmap
My first repo serves as a foundational layout template with the current knowledge I have of HTML and CSS but as I am learning Javascript, I plan on transitioning this project into a fully interactive user experience.
